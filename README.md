# NN_houdini_vex

A collection of VEX code that I use on a regular basis in Houdini. The main products are:

- anisotropy.h : contains code that helps approximate ellipsoidal collision
- discretedifferentialopartors.h : compute classic discrete differential geometry functions (e.g curvature/gradient etc.) on arbitrary meshes following Discrete Differential Operators on Polygonal Meshes, De Goes et al.
-  matrixNM.h : allow (NxM) matrices operations
